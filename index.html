        <hr size=8></hr>
        <p>I am a student of DecodeMTL and am excited to learn web development. As a longtime resident and worker from the United States
        in the East Coast, specifically Maryland, I wanted to start a new chapter in my life in a completely different place, learning
        a new skill that I am interested in. The idea of becoming a web developer is fascinating to me because of the 
        creativity and freedom it allows for my future.</p>
